# How to Contribute to Lasagna
Start by becoming familiar with how Lasagna works â€“ read [here](README.md).  

### Issues

##### Create a New Issue

If you catch an error, first check if an issue already exists for that error. 
If the error you see does not have an issue, go ahead and open an issue.

##### Solve an Issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow 
down the search using labels as filters. If you find an issue to work on, you 
are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### To Make Changes Locally

1) Fork the repository.

* Using GitHub Desktop:  
    - Getting started with GitHub Desktop will guide you through setting up 
    Desktop.  
    - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to fork the repo!
* Using the command line:
    - Fork the repo so that you can make your changes without affecting the original 
    project until you're ready to merge them. 

2) Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

* Fill out the PR, being specific about the changes you made. 
* Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.  
* Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for 
a merge. Once you submit your PR, a Lasagna team member will review your proposal. 
* We may ask questions or request additional information.  
* We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using 
suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes 
directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then 
commit them to your branch.  
* As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.  
* If you run into any merge issues, checkout this 
[git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you 
resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
