# Project Inception

*Group 02: Lasagna
Date: February 12, 2023
Group Members: Aadarsha Bastola, Dylan Franco, Marco Castrita, Nathan Underwood, Niklas Kariniemi*

## 1. Introduction:
Lasagna is a method of sending anonymous text messages from an email address. Given the number of trackers and other privacy breaches on the internet today, safety is crucial. Additionally, technology is always becoming more complex – making it less accessible to many people. Lasagna seeks to address both problems. With Lasagna, anyone can easily send an anonymous message across the globe.

**Date:** February 10, 2023
**Consumer Segment:** small business manager, social media user.

Interviewee had concerns about the project's way of safely keeping data protected, and how hateful messages sent through the program would be handled. For personal use the program seems useful for connecting to younger relatives that don’t have phones/social media. Sees some uses business wise.

**Key Insights**
- Might be used for bullying. Might be useful for some teenagers to communicate. Specific use cases with a limited customer range.

**Quotes**
“This concept reminds me of a website called yolo which was used by teenagers to text each other. However, make sure that your project doesn’t get taken down for bullying just like yolo was.”

Don’t care/ nice to have.

### Interview 9
**Interviewer:** Marco Castrita
**Interviewee:** James Seamen
**Date:** February 10, 2023
**Consumer Segment:** small business manager

**Summary**
Interviewee had didn’t think that the project would be useful for personal use. Business wise the interviewee likes the idea of being able to do anonymous surveys, and the ability to send messages in mass quantities.

**Key Insights**
- Might be more geared shade people. Data collection wise it has high potential. Might run into some legal problems. The ability to be anonymous might come in handy when messaging people to get non-bias answers.

**Quotes**
“I see shady people using something like this, as good people have no reason to be anonymous.”, 
“The ability to be anonymous would allow “Big” companies to survey customers with a lesser chance to get biased responses.”

### Interview 10
**Interviewer:** Dylan Franco
**Interviewee:** John Crenshaw
**Date:** February 11, 2023
**Consumer Segment:** Former businessman

**Summary**
As great as most mass-messaging apps are, they do not provide the customizability that Lasagna would offer in regards to the name that appears when the messages are received. Would love to see a feature to be able to use a personalized address (for a premium fee, of course).

**Key Insights**
May need to be re-marketed as a business tool and not simply just as a free thing anyone can use at any time.

**Quotes**
“Don’t quote me on this, but I think this may be a million-dollar idea.”

**Assessment**
Need
