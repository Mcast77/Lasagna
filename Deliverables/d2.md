# D2 Deliverable

## Positioning
**Problem Statement:**

The problem of mass communication affects business managers and surveyors; the impact of which is that ideas aren’t communicated and employees and survey participants are left in the dust.

**Product Position Statement**

For business managers who need to communicate with their employees, Lasagna is a simple messaging app that allows for quick and easy messaging to groups of people. Unlike competitors, our product is cheaper.
For surveyors who need to communicate with their participants, Lasagna is a simple messaging app that allows for quick and easy messaging to groups of people. Unlike x, our product allows easy anonymity. 

## Value Proposition and Customer Segment

**Value Proposition**: Mass communication and data collection made simple and affordable.

**Consumer Segments**:
- Anyone with access to a cellular or internet connected device.
- Business person wanting to send announcements/coupons
- Business person wanting to contact potential customers
- Surveyors looking for anonymous information.

### Stakeholders

**Users**: Send and receive messages

**Business Managers**: Send messages to groups of people

**Surveyors**: Send surveys for anonymous data collection

**Competitors**: TextUs, TextLine, Text Request

**Developers**: Aadarsha Bastola, Dylan Franco, Marco Castrita, Nathan Underwood, Niklas Kariniemi

### Functional Requirements

**Input**: An UI that takes two or more numbers to send to, and a message to send.

**Output**: The system should produce an email with the message the user has inputted, to the desired number.

**Computations**: The system should take the user data and temporarily store it in a database. The system should then run a script that takes the data from the database and sends it to an email relay. Once the email relay sends the email, the system deletes the initial data from the database, ensuring privacy.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Reliability**: The app should work at all times. There shouldn’t be any down time.

**Usability**: The app should be easy to use.

**Delivery Time**: The message needs to be sent in a timely manner. The message should be delivered within 30 seconds.

## MVP
Our minimum viable product consists of a simple UI and the ability to send a mass text message.
