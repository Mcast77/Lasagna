# Implementation 1



## 1. Introduction


Lasagna makes messaging and data collection simple and affordable for business minded folks. To use Lasagna, a user must first download the app. Once in the app, users can send messages to any number of phone numbers or email addresses. Since Lasagna is still under development, some features, such as text replies from recipients have yet to be implemented. To remain easy to use, Lasagna’s UI is simple and straightforward.


## 2. Implemented Requirements


## 3. Tests:

Automated unit test can be found in [https://github.com/nlu6/Lasagna/tree/main/server](https://github.com/nlu6/Lasagna/tree/main/server) 

### 3.1.4 Example Test Case
An example of a class being tested can be found in [https://github.com/nlu6/Lasagna/tree/main/server](https://github.com/nlu6/Lasagna/tree/main/server)

### 3.1.4 Result
Unfortunately, this means we are unable to provide a screenshot of the tests in-action.


## 4. Adpopted Technologies
**Flutter** - Flutter is a UI software development kit that makes it easy to develop cross-platform applications. This makes it easy to develop one application that works for both mobile and web. This cuts down development time and makes it cheaper to produce cross-platform applications. It is easy to use and provides high-quality UI design tools. 

**AWS** - AWS is a cloud computing platform that allows you to host your application on the cloud. This makes it a good place to host our server since it can be accessed from anywhere. Also a good place to store any data we need to store temporarily while sending or receiving a message. AWS also offers a free version which is what we are utilizing. 
 
**Github** - For version control and hosting all the code, we used Github. Github makes it easy to collaborate on a project by allowing a group of people to work on it on any device. It is also where we track any issues we have and in there we can keep track of what has been done and needs to be worked on. 
 
**Sendinblue** -  Sendinblue is a platform that helps you send messages of any kind to try and help build stronger relationships with your customers. We used it for the SMTP relay service which allows us to send messages to phone numbers via email. We can also customize who sent the email. For example we could have some random email send it or a random 4 digit number. This helps keep anonymity when sending messages in our application. 

**Twilio** - Twilio is a massive database of cell phone information. We use it in-tandem with the Sendinblue email service in order to determine which major carrier a certain phone number belongs to. This is due to the fact that each carrier has a domain extension specific to their service, and the right one needs to be used in order for the email to be sent to the correct phone number. While the service is not technically free, there is a trial version that offers 3100 attempts-worth of currency before needing to be upgraded.

## 5. Learning/Training
The two technologies we needed to learn about were AWS and Sendinblue. To learn both we used similar strategies. A main focus was to read documentation on the technology. Documentation can hold a lot of information and is very helpful if you get stuck on how to do something. Also just doing general research was a strategy we employed. If we couldn’t find something in the documentation, we would just look it up and try to find an answer. Also watching/reading an introduction to the technology was an important stepping stone in getting started in using that technology. 

## 6. Deployment
Some alternatives for deploying your system in the cloud:

**AWS:** AWS Educate offers free credits for students. See the tutorial at https://docker-curriculum.com/ on how to create a container and deploy it on AWS. 

**Digital Ocean or Azure:** As part of the GitHub Education benefits, as a student, you can get $100 at Digital Ocean and $100 at Microsoft Azure cloud computing platforms (see more details at https://education.github.com/students).

**Oracle Cloud:** Oracle offers a free tier in its cloud environment that should be more than enough for your needs.

**Firebase:** Firebase can be a good choice if you are building a mobile phone app. 


## 7. Licensing
For this project, we chose the GNU AGPLv3 license because it is the most restrictive. We want to ensure that our software isn’t easily redistributed by others for commercial purposes so we felt that tighter restrictions on what contributors could do was necessary.

## 9. Look and Feel
Both Mobile and Web use exact same app however the UI elements rendered according to device's respective UI, for example in Android and Web the app inherits a Material UI design and in IOS devices the device inherits Cupertino UI design.

## 10. Lessons Learned
We learned that not everything works at the first time. Testing ended up being an important part of getting the code correct. Initially, the automated test detected errors in our code. This allowed us to see what was wrong and try to correct the issues. Also learned that we should not wait so long to run a test. Realistically, we should be running tests the whole time we are developing code. This way we don’t get to the end and realize the code isn’t working properly. It is also important to leave enough time for fixing errors, so we don’t have to scramble at the last minute. In the second release we plan on creating tests in the beginning of the second iteration of the application. This way we can keep doing tests while writing code and make sure we don’t create any big issues.
