# Lasagna

### What is Lasagna?
Lasagna makes messaging and data collection simple and affordable for business 
minded folks. To use Lasagna, a user must first download the app. Once in the app, 
users can send messages to any number of phone numbers or email addresses.
Since Lasagna is still under development, some features, such as text 
replies from recipients have yet to be implemented. To remain easy to use, 
Lasagnaâ€™s UI is simple and straightforward.

### How does it work?
Lasagna's primary script is implemented in Python and the host server is written
in node.js.  
Lasagna takes advantage of SMTP technology to transfer messages. When a Lasagna
user writes a message in the app, that message is then sent off to the server.
The server stores the messages. The script is run and the message is sent through
the SMTP relay to the recipient.

### How to use Lasagna
After opening the app, a Lasagna user will type the message that they want to send.
Next, they will enter the phone numbers that they would like to send the message
to. Finally, the user will hit send, and the messages will be delivered to the
recipients.
